# Embryonic Brain Reconstruction
Features: MATLAB, Image Processing Toolbox

## Introduction
This project was to contour the brain region on embryonic slide scans acquired from Zeiss Axio Scan.Z1. The sample was stained with four different nucleus and epithelial markers, which can be used for segmentation. The images were then exported to MBF Brain Maker for image registration. 3D reconstruction was done in Imaris
